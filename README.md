# Advent of Code 2020

My take on solving the puzzles from [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)! 

Solving and learning simultaneously, **best practices** learned along the way: 
- [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) | A [version](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/#naming-styles) with examples 
- [Test-Driven Code](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/4425126-testez-votre-projet-avec-python/4434934-decouvrez-les-tests) | Course in French, Sacrebleu! 

**Concepts** that helped along the way: 
- Shallow vs Deep Copy of List in Python: [see here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html)
